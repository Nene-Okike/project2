## STEP 3 â€“ INSTALLING PHP

 Nginx requires an external program, *php-fpm*, to handle PHP processing and act as a bridge between the PHP interpreter itself and the web server;  and a a PHP module, *php-mysql*, that allows PHP to communicate with MySQL-based databases.

     $  sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql
